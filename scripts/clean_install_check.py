"""Prove this server survives a CLEAN install. Run it before you trust a green suite.

WHY
---
A local venv is a cache of a resolve that happened in the past. It cannot tell
you what a resolve TODAY would produce, and that gap is not theoretical:

    On 2026-08-20 the sibling naukri server declared `mcp[cli]>=1.25.0` with no
    upper bound. `mcp 2.0.0` shipped, relocating `mcp/server/fastmcp` to
    `mcp/server/mcpserver`. Every LOCAL naukri run stayed green -- that venv held
    mcp 1.26.0, installed before 2.0.0 existed. A clean resolve picked 2.0.0 and
    all 55 test modules died at collection: "5 deselected, 55 errors", zero tests
    run. The local venv hid a completely broken clean install for a whole day.

This script is the check that would have caught it, and the only kind that can:
it throws the cached resolve away and starts from the declared requirements.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
  1. `git clone` this repo into a throwaway workspace -- COMMITTED state only,
     so nothing here reads or disturbs your working tree
  2. clone the `jobcore` sibling next to it, because requirements.txt refers to
     it by relative path
  3. build a brand new venv
  4. run the documented install recipe from README.md ("Install and run")
  5. import server.py                <- the step the naukri bug failed
  6. run the suite, and print the resolved version of everything installed

USAGE
-----
    python scripts/clean_install_check.py [--workdir DIR] [--keep]

`--workdir` defaults to a temp directory on the same drive as the repo (a
throwaway venv is ~100 MB; do not put it on a full C:). The workspace is
deleted on success unless `--keep` is passed.

Exit code 0 means a clean install works. Non-zero means it does not, which is a
live bug even if every local run is green -- ESPECIALLY if every local run is
green.
